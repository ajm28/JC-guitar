# **Aims of the Site**

The Client has been relying on adds in music shops and word of mouth to acquire students. They would like a new website that follows these specifications:

- Clean and simple design.
- Explains what services are on offer.
- Understated colour palette.
- A form to allow potential students a means to contact client.

**UX**

As a well-known tutor in the Stirling area he has a small existing client base that is mainly built-up through word of mouth. The main aim of the new site is to foster an online presence and to increase students both face-to-face and through Zoom.

- Face-to-face students based within the Stirling area.
- Zoom students worldwide that speak English.

**Design**

- **Colour scheme**
  - The colours used are white, black and a shade of red that was sourced through the hero image.
- **Typography**
  - The Roboto font is the font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif being the fallback font.
- **Imagery**
  - All images were supplied by the Client.

# **User stories**

&quot;As a visitor I want to be able to easily navigate through the site&quot;

&quot;As a visitor I want to be given clear and concise information on what the business offers&quot;

&quot;As a visitor I want to be able to read reviews and feel confident that they are a good teacher&quot;

&quot;As a visitor I want to be able to contact the business via email, phone, where the business is located etc.&quot;

## Wireframe Mockups:

During the design process wireframes were produced with client input using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) Minor adjustments were made from original to allow for better visual appeal.
